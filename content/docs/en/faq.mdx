# Frequently Asked Questions

This section addresses common questions about Threadseeker, including security concerns and explanations of statistical data.

## Why do I need to log in with a Google account? üòñ

Logging in with a Google account helps prevent misuse of our backend systems. It's solely for authentication purposes. **We do not and cannot access your Google account password.**

When you log in to any site using Google, the site receives:

- Your account name
- Your email address
- Your profile picture

For Threadseeker, we only record your email to track if you've logged in before and how many times you've queried in a day (to prevent abuse). We do not use your email for any commercial purposes or marketing.

If you're uncomfortable with the requirement to log in with a Google account, you may choose not to use Threadseeker.

## Why is the Google login domain different from Threadseeker? üßê

This is not a security issue. It occurs because I haven't upgraded Threadseeker's backend database service (we use [Supabase](https://supabase.com)), so the Google login screen shows Supabase's default domain.

This does not affect your account security. You can verify the login page URL is `google.com`. I do not access your Google account password. The seemingly random URL is the actual backend database URL, not a phishing site.

## Is there any risk to my Threads account after analysis? üòØ

**Conclusion: Threadseeker does not have access to your Threads account password or any private data.**

The site simulates a non-following Threads user to gather publicly available data and post statistics, presenting the results in a final report.

Therefore, using Threadseeker for analysis poses no risk to your Threads account. The data shown in the report is information anyone could already view.

Essentially, the data the program can access is similar to what Google can access, but I use programming to compile it more efficiently.

(It's important to understand that anyone can write a program to automatically compile your public data on Threads, Instagram, Facebook, etc. The only way to prevent others from analyzing your posts is to set your account to private.)

## Will my Threads account query history be stored? üò•

Threadseeker temporarily retains query records for "which Google accounts queried which Threads accounts" for 24 hours before deletion.

The reason for temporarily storing query records is due to a daily query limit mechanism. This means each Google user can only analyze one new Threads account per day. To check how many new Threads account analyses a Google account has requested in a day, this data needs to be retained, not for marketing or statistical analysis purposes.

However, if you query a Threads account that has already been analyzed, the site will not record your query behavior. Threadseeker only records actions for "querying Threads accounts that have not been analyzed before."

Similarly, if you're concerned about the temporary retention of query records, you are welcome to choose not to use this service.

## Can I unlink my Google account from Threadseeker? üòó

If you decide to stop using Threadseeker and want to disconnect your Google account, you can follow Google's official instructions to unlink your account from Threadseeker:

1. Go to the [Your Third-Party Connections](https://myaccount.google.com/connections) page in your Google Account.
2. Select "Sign in with Google."
3. Select the third-party app or service you want to unlink, then "View details."
4. Select "Disable 'Sign in with Google'" and then "Confirm."

## How is the Active Network Level calculated? üòé

The Active Network Level is based on the "average number of posts per day" indicator. It assigns a corresponding level based on your account's daily posting frequency in the overall data's PR value, similar to a percentile ranking method.

- C: Below PR 35
- B: PR 35 ~ 40
- B+: PR 40 ~ 50
- A: PR 50 ~ 75
- A+ PR 75 ~ 85
- A++ PR 85 ~ 90
- S: PR 90 - 95
- SSS: Above PR 95

Therefore, the Active Network Level in the analysis report may change over time and with data volume.
