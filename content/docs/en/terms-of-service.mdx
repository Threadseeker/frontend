# Terms of Service

Welcome to Threadseeker! (referred to hereafter as "the Website," "we," "our services," or "the Platform"). This website is developed, maintained, and operated by [cjs.shawn](https://jcshawn.com). Threadseeker is a third-party service and is not affiliated with Threads.net.

This service provides insights into the usage data of Threads accounts (all references to Threads herein refer to services provided by Threads.net). It allows you to analyze the performance and influence of your content on Threads and adjust your strategy based on data-driven insights.

Please read these Terms carefully as they contain important information about the services we offer, changes to these Terms, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, waiver of class-action rights, and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court.

By using or accessing our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you may not use or access our services in any manner.

Our [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy) outlines how we collect and use your data, and these Terms specify your responsibilities when using our services. By using our services, you agree to comply with these Terms and our Privacy Policy.

2. **We do not and cannot access your Threads account password.** The service only accesses public data from Threads accounts through our backend system.

## Updates to Terms

If any updates to these Terms affect your usage or legal rights, we will notify you via an in-platform message.

If you disagree with the updates, you may [contact us](/about) before the effective date of the changes to terminate your access.

## Miscellaneous

If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable. These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of China (Taiwan).
