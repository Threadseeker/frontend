# About Threadseeker

Hey there! Thanks for checking out this page. I'm Shawn, the university student behind Threadseeker. I'm currently a sophomore at the College of Management at National Taiwan University. Threadseeker is a fun little project I whipped up in just three days because I wanted to dive into social media analytics. I hope you enjoy this creation of mine!

Have you tried [Threadseeker](https://threadseeker.com) yet? If not, give it a go! You can explore interaction stats and account data for public profiles, including total likes, comments, and more.

## Why I Created Threadseeker

I'm a big fan of scrolling through Threads and joined when there were only about 3 million members (most people joined after it hit 10 million). I'm always curious about how Threads differs from other platforms, like its audience, algorithms, and potential business models.

Threads is fascinating because viral posts pop up more frequently here than on other platforms. Plus, the nature of the platform encourages people to "be themselves," leading to lively discussions and interactions.

Interestingly, the Instagram CEO once mentioned in a live stream that Taiwan is one of the best-performing regions for Threads, which shows just how much we love it here.

I wanted to understand the current state of Threads from a data perspective, so I spent three days building a website that lets you see how active you are on Threads, along with your recent likes and comments. That's how Threadseeker came to be.

## How to Use the Data

While I initially designed this site to be like those fun Instagram quizzes you share on your stories, I ended up creating a "Network Activity Analyzer" instead of a full-fledged social media analytics tool.

The activity level calculation is based on common social media metrics, primarily focusing on "average daily post count" and ranking it using PR values. You can also use the report data to calculate your account's engagement rate by adding likes and comments and dividing by total followers. On Instagram, maintaining over 1% is considered pretty good.

This is a great way to gauge how engaged your followers are with your posts!

So, use Threadseeker to check out your account or see how popular brands are doing on Threads. Discover what makes certain accounts buzz with activity. That's the original motivation behind this site.

## Technical Details

I'll be writing a detailed blog post on my [blog](https://jcshawn.com) about how I developed this site and the analytics flow. Stay tuned!

Update 2024-04-15: I wrote a [technical development note in English](https://medium.com/@jcshawn/how-i-built-a-threads-analytics-tool-with-10-000-users-in-3-days-e4ac37416eae) on Medium. If you're interested in programming or the implementation behind Threadseeker, feel free to check it out.
